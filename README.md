# React Todo App - Dark Blue Theme

A modern and attractive **Todo Application** built with **React**. This app uses a **dark theme with blue accents** for a sleek look and includes all the core features of a Todo list â€” adding, completing, and deleting tasks.

---

## Project Overview

This project was created as a beginner-friendly React practice. Unlike multi-component structures, the entire app logic and UI are written inside a single `App.js` file for simplicity and easy understanding.

### What you will find in the code:

- **State Management:** Using React's `useState` hook to manage the list of tasks and the current input.
- **Add Tasks:** Input box and button to add new todos.
- **Toggle Completion:** Click on a todo item to mark it as complete/incomplete with visual feedback.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks individually.
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with a dark background, blue buttons, and modern hover animations.

## How it works

- The todo list is stored in the component state as an array of objects.
- New todos are added by typing in the input and clicking the "Add" button.
- Each todo item can be toggled between done/undone by clicking it.
- Each todo can be deleted by clicking the delete icon.
- The UI updates instantly as you interact with the app.
